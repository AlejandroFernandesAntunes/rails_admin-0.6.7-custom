# rails_admin-0.6.7-custom

This is the 0.6.7 version of sferik rails admin. https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin
An application I am working on is stuck on this particular version, but there were a bug in which if a model is hidden from the left menu using visible; then the user is not able to index that model from within another view. That as fixed in 0.6.8 but some other errors were introduced there, and due to many other dependencies from the project I was forced to use this as a solution.
